For the project, you'll need to first install the "ultrasonic.h" 
library to use the ultrasonic sensor, the "WiFi.h" library for 
the ESP to access the internet, and "ESPAsyncWebServer.h" and 
"AsyncTCP.h" libraries to create and communicate with the web socket, 
respectively.

In this part of the code 

const char* ssid = "mesh_24";
const char* password = "Ma101002"; 

you should input your internet's SSID and password.
